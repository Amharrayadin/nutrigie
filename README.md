# NutriGie: Your Daily Nutrition Guide
## Introduction
NutriGie is an app designed to make healthy eating simple and convenient. By recommending foods based on your personal preferences and nutritional needs, and helping you track your daily nutritional intake, NutriGie puts healthier choices at your fingertips.

But we're not just creating an app. We're aiming to build a bridge, a bridge that can help you cross from confusion and unhealthy habits to a world where balanced nutrition is as easy as it is.
